# azrb

**azrb** is a cross-platform CLI cheat sheet manager written in Go. With azrb you can easily create, view, edit, delete, and list cheat sheetsâ€”simple Markdown files that store useful commands, tips, and reference material. Built with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper), azrb is designed to work on Linux, Windows, and macOS with minimal configuration.

## Installation

### From Source

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/) (version 1.18 or later) installed. Then clone the repository and build the binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Younes-khadraoui/azrb.git
cd azrb
go build -o azrb .
```

Alternatively, install via:

```bash
go install github.com/Younes-khadraoui/azrb@latest
```

Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system PATH so that you can run `azrb` from anywhere.

### Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Younes-khadraoui/azrb/releases) page. We use [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to automate the build and release process.

## Configuration

By default, azrb uses the following settings:
- **Storage Directory**: `~/.azrb` (where cheat sheets are saved)
- **Default Editor**:
  - Unix-like systems: `nvim` (or the value of the `$EDITOR` environment variable)
  - Windows: `notepad`

You can override these settings in two ways:

1. **Using a Configuration File**:  
   Create a file named `~/.azrb.yaml` with contents like:

   ```yaml
   storageDir: "/path/to/your/cheatsheets"
   editor: "your_preferred_editor"
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   export AZRB_STORAGE_DIR="/path/to/your/cheatsheets"
   export AZRB_EDITOR="your_preferred_editor"
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use azrb with the following commands:

- **View a Cheat Sheet**:  
  ```bash
  azrb <cheatsheet-name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  azrb pandas
  ```

- **Create a Cheat Sheet**:  
  ```bash
  azrb create <cheatsheet-name>
  ```
  This command creates a new Markdown file (e.g., `~/.azrb/pandas.md`) and opens your default editor.

- **Edit a Cheat Sheet**:  
  ```bash
  azrb edit <cheatsheet-name>
  ```

- **Delete a Cheat Sheet**:  
  ```bash
  azrb delete <cheatsheet-name>
  ```

- **List All Cheat Sheets**:  
  ```bash
  azrb list
  ```

- **Show Current Configuration**:  
  ```bash
  azrb config
  ```

- **Help**:  
  Display help text:
  ```bash
  azrb --help
  ```

## Release Process

We follow semantic versioning. **To release version v1.0.0:**

1. **Tag your release**:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Run GoReleaser**:  
   With your tag in place and your `.goreleaser.yml` configured, run:

   ```bash
   goreleaser release --rm-dist
   ```

   GoReleaser will build your CLI tool for Linux, Windows, and macOS, create archives, and publish them to GitHub Releases under version **v1.0.0**.
